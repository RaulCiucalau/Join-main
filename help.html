        <p>Welcome to the help page for <a href="#">Join</a>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool.
            Here, you'll learn what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p><a href="#">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="#">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban
            to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that <a href="#">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended
            for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <a href="#">Join</a>.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Join</h2>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="#">Join</a>:</p>

        <ol class="usage-steps">
            <li>
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                <p>When you log in to <a href="#">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your
                    project and
                    contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                <p>In <a href="#">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                    section, click
                    on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                    tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                    the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                    will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                    action is irreversible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Remember that using <a href="#">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your

                    the board reflects the current state of your project.
